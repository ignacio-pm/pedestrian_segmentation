# Pedestrian Instance Segmentation with Mask R-CNN

Abstract: Instance segmentation is a complex yet useful task in computer vision. In this paper, the task of segmenting pedestrians in an image is accomplished with a Mask R-CNN model on the Penn-Fudan Dataset. Moreover, object detection with a simpler backbone is executed. The performance of both models is compared and it is discussed why the precision of this application is higher than the original model on the COCO dataset.

The code is avaliable at the repository in two Jupiter notebooks. The first one is imported from Google Colab and can be run there. The second one is the same notebook without the output, which can cause difficulties in the reading of the file.
